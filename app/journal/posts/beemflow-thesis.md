## The BeemFlow Thesis

Alright, let’s get real for a second. I didn’t set out to build some fancy new automation protocol because I thought the world needed another SaaS. Honestly, I just wanted to buy a bunch of “boring” businesses from retiring boomers, juice them up with some AI, and ride the greatest wealth transfer of our generation. Simple, right?

But here’s where it gets interesting. I started digging into how people are actually automating these businesses, and what I found blew my mind. There are folks out there--no-code hustlers, not even engineers--pulling in $100k+ a month running “AI automation agencies” with tools like n8n and Make.com. They’re wiring up APIs, gluing together spreadsheets, and making bank. Major respect. But also... what the hell?? If they can do that with drag-and-drop, what could I do with a real toolset?

So I dove in. I’ve always been the guy who builds my own tools (shoutout QueryGPT, which lets you talk to your database in plain English). I live and breathe LLMs, and I know firsthand how much faster and more flexible code can be compared to clicking around in a no-code UI. But the more I tried to use these “automation” platforms, the more I realized: they’re slow, clunky, and honestly, they get in my way more than they help.

That’s when it hit me. LLMs are killer at working with text: markdown, mermaid diagrams, you name it. The whole AI community is moving in that direction, and for good reason. So why not describe automations in markdown? Why not make a protocol that’s as easy for an LLM to understand as it is for a human? Why not make something that’s actually fun to use, whether you’re a dev or a business owner who just wants shit to work?

That’s how BeemFlow was born. It started as “FlowSpec-XL” (yeah, I know, terrible name), then “AgentFlow,” and finally landed on BeemFlow—more to that story another day 😉. At its core, BeemFlow is like GitHub Actions, but for automating anything in your business or life. YAML-native, AI-first, and mind-bogglingly flexible. If you can describe it, BeemFlow can run it. It’s the backbone for the SaaS I’m building next: a chat + visual editor that’s actually pleasant to use, and powerful enough to automate anything from a mom-and-pop shop to a full-on enterprise. It's going to walk you through automating your entire business, then your entire life.

But here’s the kicker: this isn’t just about software. It’s a flywheel. I'm using BeemFlow to automate businesses, make them more profitable, and then--when the time is right--acquire the best ones. Every automation I build, every workflow I refine, makes the whole system stronger. The SaaS gets better, the businesses get smarter, and the cycle keeps spinning.

This is the meta-play. It’s not just about selling software or services. It’s about owning the stack, compounding value, and building leverage at every layer. And yeah, it’s about having fun and making a real impact along the way.

So if you’re reading this and thinking, "Damn, I want in"—good. You should. Because this is just the beginning, and I’m looking for people who get it. People who want to build, invest, or just ride shotgun on the wildest business and tech transformation of our time. Beemflow is going to make all of this accessible, but I can't, and don't want to do it alone.

Program the world, baby. Let’s make some noise.
